# Summer Programming Challenges Solutions

----
## What will this resource contain?
This will contain solutions, pseudocode algorithms and eventually flowcharts coded by me for you to see and understand if you have no idea where to start. I will be regularly updating it.

----
## Usage
For the questions themselves, see the Code Challenges PDF, questions 1 through 8.

Open the Challenges folder. For each question there will be a folder, which will contain:

1. *A_python_solution*.py

2. *A\_pseudocode_explanation*.algorithm
3. *A_flowchart*.pdf

Also, if you see any issues, go to the Issues page on the right hand side, and create an issue, telling me what the problem is and your proposed solution is. You don't have to create a GitHub account for this.

Good luck! Also read the stuff below.
